# SSL/TLS stands for Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security. 

These are protocols that allow devices and applications to communicate securely over the internet: 

**SSL**
An older protocol that creates a secure connection between devices. SSL certificates are issued to a specific domain name and web server after a Certificate Authority (CA) vets the organization requesting the certificate.

**TLS**
An upgraded version of SSL that fixes some of its security flaws. TLS authenticates more efficiently than SSL.

SSL/TLS certificates are used to: 
* Authenticate the identity of a website
* Establish an encrypted connection between a browser and a web server
* Secure online transactions
* Protect data transmission from unauthorized access
