# AZURE A LEARNING GUIDE


**What is Azure?**


Microsoft Azure is an ever-expanding set of cloud services to help your organization meet your business challenges. Itâ€™s the freedom to build, manage, and deploy applications on a massive, global network using your favorite tools and frameworks.
Azure is Microsoft's cloud solution. A cloud is essentially a collection of host data centers that you don't have to directly manage. You can request services from that cloud Cost, Global scale, performance, security, speed, productivity, Reliability.

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform that offers services and products to help users build, run, and manage applications: 


**Services and products**
Azure offers over 200 products and services, including analytics, storage, networking, and virtual computing. 


**Solutions**
Azure offers solutions for various industries, such as retail and manufacturing. 


**Benefits**
Azure offers benefits such as enhanced security, compliance, backup and recovery capabilities, and simplified management. 

**Flexibility**
Azure offers flexibility to choose preferred technology, tools, and languages. 


**Access**
Azure offers access to industry-leading AI services, cloud infrastructure, and an intelligent data platform. 

**Access and management**
Azure provides an online portal that allows users to access and manage cloud services and resources. 


**Capabilities**
Azure provides capabilities that are usually not included within other cloud platforms, including software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

## Azure is Responsible for:


In an Azure cloud environment, the responsibilities are divided between Microsoft (Azure) and the customer, following a shared responsibility model. Based on your statement, Azure is responsible for the following aspects:


**1. Availability of the Platform (Datacenter, Connectivity, Server, Power, Cooling):**


Azure is responsible for ensuring that the underlying infrastructure, including the physical data centers, power supply, network connectivity, servers, and cooling systems, are available and maintained. This includes ensuring the physical hardware and its supporting systems (such as power and cooling) are operational and resilient.


**2.	Data Availability:**


Azure is responsible for the availability of services and platforms, ensuring the infrastructure is designed for high availability, redundancy, and disaster recovery. However, customers must implement their own strategies for data availability, such as backups, replication, and failover.


**3.	Maintenance of the Platform (Datacenter, Connectivity, Server, Storage):**


Azure is responsible for the regular maintenance of the underlying platform, which includes updating and patching hardware, software, and infrastructure. This also includes maintaining servers, storage, network, and ensuring that the physical environment remains up-to-date and operational.


**4.	Physical Security:**


Azure ensures the physical security of data centres, including access control, surveillance, and protection from physical threats. This involves securing the hardware, buildings, and network connections from unauthorized physical access and ensuring that the environment is resilient to physical attacks or failures.


**5.	Availability of the Service (VM, Storage, Network):**


Azure ensures the availability of the services it provides, such as virtual machines (VMs), storage, and networking. This means managing the infrastructure to ensure it is available for the customer, including handling the orchestration, scaling, and maintenance of these services.



**Shared Responsibility Model:**


*Customer's Responsibility:*
The customer is responsible for things like configuring services correctly, managing the applications they deploy, maintaining data security, and setting up proper access controls.


*Azure's Responsibility:* 
Azure handles the infrastructure level, ensuring the platform and its services (network, compute, storage, etc.) are operational and secure.
